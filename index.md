# WebGL Game of Life

A component for displaying and playing [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using WebGL run on the host system's GPU.

Implemented in TypeScript using [Lit](https://lit.dev) for compilation to native, reusable WebComponents.

[A live demo of the application is available here](https://jmicheli.github.io/webgl-gol/app).

## Tooling and deployment

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in its build process. These have configuration files located in `tools/` to keep the root directory small.

The project is deployed as a GitHub page at [jmicheli.github.io/webgl-gol](https://jmicheli.github.io/webgl-gol) using GitHub Actions.
